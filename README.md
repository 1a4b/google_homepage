# google_homepage
The google homepage project for The Odin Project

The goal of this project was to recreate the basic elements of the Google homepage design with HTML/CSS. 
I first attempted to position the elements on my own, with the assistance of HTML/CSS resources and googling specific problems. Then as needed, and to recreate specific colors and formmatting, I referenced the Google homepage code. 
The goal was not a perfect copy or anyfunctionality, but to gain more comfort with HTML/CSS.
